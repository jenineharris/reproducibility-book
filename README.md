###### BOOK DESCRIPTION

Science is arguably better than common sense at helping us understand the world, yet it is still far from perfect. In recent decades, the academic culture of publish or perish has collided with technological advances in publishing resulting in an exponential growth in published research. Whether by correlation or causation (or both), challenges currently facing science coincide with this rapid growth, including increasing rates of retraction, a lack of research reproducibility, and the proliferation of predatory journals. So, while science is moving quickly on quantity, increases in quantity are coming at the expense of research quality. Low quality research has high human and financial costs not only for those participating in the research, but also for society.

One way to improve scientific quality is to use reproducible research practices. Research is reproducible when the data and software are accessible, and the data management and analysis steps are clear and complete. While some reproducible research practices have become more common, there is a notable lack of widespread adoption of many reproducible research practices. When asked what would facilitate their own use of reproducible research practices, the top answer from public health researchers was training on reproducible research practices.

This book aims to fill this need by providing undergraduate and graduate students in the social sciences with an introduction to reproducible research practices. To my knowledge, no book exists with the purpose of providing guidance on developing reproducible research practices in the social sciences. The text is designed as a supplemental text for research methods courses and for introductory and intermediate statistics courses across social science disciplines.
