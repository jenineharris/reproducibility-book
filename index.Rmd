# Chapter 1: Science vs. Memes (\#chapter1)

> "I don't know if Franklin actually said this but I like it anyway!" -
> Uncle Nick, Facebook, August 30, 2016

In the months just prior to the 2016 Presidential election, the
political differences between me and some of my family members became
very clear. One place this showed up was on Facebook, where I would use
Fact Checking websites like Snopes to challenge or debunk memes often
showing false quote or facts posted by my Uncle Nick. This frequent
interaction culminated in Nick adding a disclaimer (quoted above) to a
meme he shared on Facebook. The meme included a picture of Benjamin
Franklin with the quote, "Make yourself sheep and the wolves will eat
you" attributed to Franklin and a logo for The Patriot Post. This quote
is accurately attributed to Benjamin Franklin, but this was not
important to Nick. The important part was that he liked the quote and
wanted to share it with others. Nick is not the only one using social
media to share information, nor is social media the only place where
information is shared.

In everyday life we are surrounded by sources of information. We have
online and offline conversations with friends and colleagues and Uncle
Nick, read comments from strangers on the internet, watch news online
and on television, and read magazines and books and government reports.
Maybe we even look up and read (or skim) the occasional scientific
article. Not all of these sources of information are the same. Sources
of information vary widely in quality.

There are many different things that can impact the quality of
information. Information quality can be impacted by the author of the
information through author bias, author motive, and author expertise.
Information quality can also be impacted by the .

Author bias

Author motive

Author expertise

## The scientific quality crisis 

The impact on human health 

ii. Reasons for poor quality 
1. Fraud (26%) 
2. Error (74%)  

## How reproducible research can help 

i. Increases research quality, promotes collaboration, reduces research waste 
ii. Distinction from repeatable and replicable iii. 

## Qualities that make research reproducible 

1. Access to data and software 

2. Well-organized statistical code or sufficiently detailed methods
